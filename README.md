# crm_cleaning_project

**The problem I want to solve** :

Ignition’s sales team lacks of rigor when using our CRM : the data is not clean, and there are lots of missing data. So the CRM doesn’t allow us (for the moment) to lead insighful analysis about our customers and sales.

I’ll focus first on Deals, then Companies, and if I have time Contacts


**Objectives** :

1. creating a cleaning tool to regularly be able to clean our CRM 
2. Further steps (if I have time, or for final project) : leading a cross-selling analysis :

→ Seasonality ? Turnover per client ? Net profit per client ? Average basket ? Repeat Business ?

→ understand factors driving sales at Ignition : customers’ drivers

→ top 20% customers (top = 1% // Large = 4% // Medium = 15%) + factors driving sales for these clients ?

→ top time wasters (the clients who are taking up most of our time but aren’t vital for our business → do we paddle them away ?)

→ Churn rate (when and why do they leave) ? How to retain customers at ignition ? Customer lifetime value ? (comparing between loyal and broken relationships)

3. cross data between our CRM and our internal matching tool (B2C data - candidates)
